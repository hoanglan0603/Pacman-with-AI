                                                                THIS IS A PROJECT OF PACMAN GAME

It is implemented by a group of four people: Nhung, Ngoc, Lan and Lam
The source code is refered from this link 'https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/home.html'
From this link, you can see many file that were implemented by a group of professors
Our task is to implement files that haven't been coded with python 
It is finised in three weeks with work of each week like the following:
  First week:
    Learning Search algorithms
    We start to implement all uncoded functions in files search.py and searchAgents.py
  Second week:
    Learning Multi-Agents Search algorithms
    We implement all uncoded functions in file multiAgents.py
  Third week:
    Learning Reinforcement with machine learning
    We implement all uncoded functions in files valueIterationAgents.py and qlearningAgents.py
